# EintechTest

A quick code example for Eintech.

## Notes

- In this example, I've included my appsettings.Development.json file, just to show the entire project. However, in a production environment, this file would be hidden using .gitignore, so the database connectionstring doesn't end up in the repo.

- The front-end is fairly minimal. With more time, I would probably make it more responsive and dynamic.
